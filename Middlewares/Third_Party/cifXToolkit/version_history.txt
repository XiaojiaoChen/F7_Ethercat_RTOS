cifX-Toolkit Version History:
=============================

Known Problems:
 - Automatic file upload for PCI hardware not implemented

V1.4.0.0
-----------------
 - Improved ISR handler by reading only necessary handshake registers on PCI cards
 - Fixed LINT warning in DEV_DoSystemStart(), multiple definition of ptSysChannel
 - Fixed LINT warning by adding type casts
 - Fixed xSysdeviceInfo()/CIFX_INFO_CMD_SYSTEM_CHANNEL_BLOCK for use with SPM, removed access via the "DPM pointer"
 - Fixed xSysdeviceExtendedMemory() missing convert/HWIF function when reading tSystemState
 - Renamed "md5" files to "Hilmd5" preventing conflicts with custom components using same file name
 - xChannelIORead()/xChannelIOWrite() does not return COM flag state in "uncontrolled mode"
 - DEV_IsCommunicating() removed re-read of NCF_Handshake flags for SPM speed improvment

V1.3.0.0
-----------------
 - Fixed DSR Handler channel loop counting preventing one additional iteration
 - Fixed compiler warnings created by implicit data conversion on 64bit systems
 - Fixed Lint warnings in cifXInit.c
 - Fixed notification call "post reset event" (eCIFX_TOOLKIT_EVENT_POSTRESET) done to late
 - Added system state trace log information (e.g. DPM cookie) during start-up
 - Added include in cifXUser.h surrounding <#if _MSC_VER> allowing none Microsoft compiler using -wundef

V1.2.0.1
-----------------
 - Remove single line comment (not allowed in ANSI-C)

V1.2.0.0
-----------------
 - Changed function interface of the hardware read/write functions (PFN_HWIF_MEMCPY). Using void pointer instead of uint32_t
   for address parameter, skips address calculation for memory mapped devices on 64bit systems.
 - xChannelSyncState() may not work on flash-based devices (if no reset is done during initialization)
   or after xSysdeviceReset()
 - Added target independent protocol implementation for serial DPM handling
 - xChannelRegisterNotification/CIFX_NOTIFY_COM_STATE now calls always the user callback to signal the actual COM flag state
 - Interrupt mode with shared PCI interrupts may result in invalid flags being handled in seldom cases
 - Added support for IAR C/C++ Compiler (ARM Cores only)
 - Added support for armcc Compiler (previously known as ARM RealView)
 - Always check cookie before evaluation of READY flag to prevent misinterpretation of invalid DPM content
 - Updated 2nd Stage Loader to V1.4.17.0
 - Introduced eCHIP_TYPE_NETX52 to distinguish between netX51 and netX52
 - Introduced initial wait for bootloader startup before invoking POST_BOOTLOADER event
 - Mailbox notification may cause illegal memory access due to missing hardware interface abstraction and endianness conversion
 - DMA mode does not work properly on big endian machines due to missing endianness conversion

V1.1.5.0
-----------------
 - DEV_TransferPacket() may drop unexpected packets
 - DEV_WaitForBitstate_Poll / DEV_WaitForSynchState_Poll may wait one additional cycle before returning
 - netX51/52 RAM Based device support
   ATTENTION: DPM Timings might need to be adjusted in eCIFX_TOOLKIT_EVENT_PRE_BOOTLOADER notification callback,
              as RDY signal is not activated by ROM loader. If the host has strict timings (e.g. NXPCA-PCI), the 
              DPM won't be readable.
              
              Sample code:
                case eCIFX_TOOLKIT_EVENT_PRE_BOOTLOADER:
                  if(eCHIP_TYPE_NETX51 == ptDevInst->eChipType)
                  {
                    /* netX51 has a timing configuration without rdy/busy, so we need to adjust it here, to be able to access 
                       memory starting at offset 0x100 */
                    NETX51_DPM_CONFIG_AREA_T* ptDpmConfig = (NETX51_DPM_CONFIG_AREA_T*)ptDevInst->pbDPM;

                    ptDpmConfig->ulDpmRdyCfg    = MSK_NX56_dpm_rdy_cfg_rdy_pol |           /* DPM is ready when external RDY-signal is high. */
                                                 (1 << SRT_NX56_dpm_rdy_cfg_rdy_drv_mode); /* Push-Pull Mode */
                    ptDpmConfig->ulDpmTimingCfg = 0; /* Disable setup times and filter. */
                  }
                  break;

V1.0.4.0
-----------------
 - Starting automatically downloaded configuration database may fail for flash based devices

V1.0.3.0
-----------------
 - Handshake Flags may get out of synch when doing a system start in interrupt mode, if
   firmware asserts interrupt at unexpected time

   state in interrupt mode (influences loadable modules)

V1.0.1.0
-----------------
 - DSR Handler crashes due to invalid access on a communication channel instance
 - xSysdeviceReset is now locked against ISR/DSR or Cyclic Thread. Earlier versions
   may write invalid handshake flags during a system start if the cyclic thread or IRQ

   confirmation packet taking longer than expected

 - If start of Firmware fails (e.g. wrong HW options) the card will not
   be rejected by toolkit. It will be used as a card with a system device only.
 - xChannelPLCMemoryPointer may not working correctly due to an invalid parameter 
   passed to OS_MapUserPointer / UnmapUserPointer
 - GetMDRequest may fail depending on the implementation of OS_Strncpy
 - xChannelPLCActivateRead / Write did not lock access to handshake flags
 - cifXHandleWarmstart() using same buffer for send/receive in TransferPacket() fixed
 - DEV_DeleteFile(), OS_Strncpy() size of copied data must include the necessary 0 character
 - DEV_Download() uses twice the packet timeout (=10s) for the last packet if modules are loaded
